# Real-Time IoT Device Connectivity Management (C Project)

This project simulates **real-time IoT device connectivity management** using C language and socket programming.  
It demonstrates how IoT devices send connectivity data to a central server, and how the server monitors **status, battery, and latency** in real-time.

## ‚ö° Features
- Multiple IoT devices simulated using C
- Server receives data in JSON-like format
- Alerts:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Device offline detection
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Low battery (<20%) warning
- Real-time monitoring with continuous updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **Language:** C
- **Platform:** Linux/WSL (Ubuntu)
- **Concepts:** Socket Programming, JSON-like data format
